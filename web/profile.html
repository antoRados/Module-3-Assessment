    <h3>Career Goals</h3>
    <p>
        My career aspirations are to find a job as an iOS          developer, at a company whose moral compass aligns with my own.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ideally, I would progress through different seniority levels within the iOS department, and eventually make it to a managerial position.
    </p>
    <p>
        As I gain experience I would love to start my own consulting or contracting firm, and make that a full-time job, in the hopes of being able to work less and enjoy travelling more frequently.  The end goal is to live life outside of your typical 9-5, and retire while I can still be physically active.
    </p>
