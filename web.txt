    The web, to me, looks like a literal spider web.  Everything in the web realm is 
interconnected through packet exchanges, and data transfer.  If you have a website 
that requires user input, posting information somewhere, and receiving information
back from a server you are using many different technologies working together to
accomplish this.
    If you look at a standard website, and assume that the back-end is on a remote
server, you need to establish a connection to said server before you can receive
or send any sort of data.  Once a connection is established you can send send data
to the server, and then need to await a response.  The information you send or receive
can be in many formats, JSON being one of those.  Your website code will need to address
requesting data from the server, GET, sending data to the server or updating data, POST,
or removing data, DELETE, your code needs to communicate.
    Through these requests and replies we are able to let the user communicate with the
web server and allow for information relay.  This can look like a user putting in their
username, and password to check their online banking accounts.  It can look like a person
filling out a job application which will transmit to the company all of the user's
qualification.
When you get a group of these websites communicating it starts to resemble a highway of
data exchange.  While the web is vast and unique, it is all built on the infrastucture
of the internet - which is esentially the framework that allows for communication among
devices.
